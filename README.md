# ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ Thaisense

> Add Thai language support to Typesense

Thaisense adds another layer on top of [Typesense](https://typesense.org/)'s API so that queries are "chopped" by word-split algorithm. The results (queried against chopped index file) are then merged back before passing it back to the user.
